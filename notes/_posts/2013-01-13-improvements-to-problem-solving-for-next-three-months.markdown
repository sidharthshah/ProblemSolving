category: posts
---

Following are some goals that need to be achived over next three months 

### Get in the Game ###
* Dedicate 15hrs/week with every alternative day 
* Two whole day sessions per month dedicated to problem solving

### Improve Algorithm Skills ###
* Refresh Algorithmic Techniques like: Greedy method, Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conqure, Max Flow/Min cuts, Shortest Path, BFS
* Refresh Datastructures: Stacks, Queus, Binary Trees, Priority Queues, Hashtables

### Improve Implementation Skills ###
* Basic C++ & STL
* Read more C++ Submissions 
* Create reusable common libs and macros 

### Improve Math Skills ###
* Statistics 
* Probability 
* Geometry 
* Matricies & Optimization Stuff
